# Cryptocurrency-Mining-Calculator
Computes optimized reinvestment rates for maximum return on investment for providers, auch as Genesis and Hashflare mining.

The Python script optimizes the reinvest strategy for a maximum return on investment based on a given timeframe or end date.

Conclusions:
* It is best to reinvest everything up to a certain point and then stop reinvesting.
* The time to stop is not necessarily one year before the optimized period. This means that hashpower may be left past the time period optimized for, further increasing the return on investment.
